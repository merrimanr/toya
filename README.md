# Memcached on YARN -
## Version 0.10-Core Alpha 


## Futures ##
* Configure alloted ram for **Demon currently requires a 512mb container to function** as 448mb goes to the JMemcachD Deamon
* Getting containers that die to automatically restart
* Get the Application Master to restart if it dies
* Management of the clients. Currently I have to kill clients through the YARN Cli. 

      
      `yarn application -kill [app#] `
      

* Adding in unit tests and sample/test applications 
* Client Memcached system notification if a server daemon dies. 
* Have MOYA clean things up if the AM dies or is exited. 
* Configure Evition Policy, currently set as **FIFO**
* Configure Number of Keys to handle, currently **set at 1million per Daemon**
* Migrate paramaters to configeration file
